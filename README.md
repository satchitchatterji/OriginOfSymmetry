Within this repository is the code that is needed to reproduce and build on the results of the paper ***Testing Emergent Bilateral Symmetry in Evolvable Robots with Vision***, accepted to ECTA 2024. The code is heavily build upon *Revolve2*, (repository at [github.com/ci-group/revolve2](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve2), documentation at [ci-group.github.io/revolve2](https://ci-group.github.io/revolve2/)), specifically pre-release version v0.4.0-beta2. Due to this, it is not as readable as we'd have hoped, and is a working repository.
